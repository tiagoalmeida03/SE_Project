Each week a chart with the time spent by each member should be created and added to the file **PM/weeklyReports/group-{group-number}/`{week_number}`.png**. The file should be in png format, and should follow the template available in this link: https://www.canva.com/design/DAFwFzZwn6Q/E_yyn3kA62aNKspN5s1-Hg/edit

The chart should be edited so that the group and week number are filled, and the chart should be updated with the time spent by each member in the week.
